Here Are Some Projects You Can Do To Build Your JavaScript or any other programming language skill. I will tell you about various projects that you can do to make your programming skill more strong. These are beginner-level projects just to understand things like how to utilize APIs, Design UI & how to set functionality in web and mobile application.  Build a project from scratch is a very good way to understand programming language or framework.

Here is the list of projects you can check for both UI and logic perspective-

E-attendance system-

Try to make an attendance system.

Chatbot-

To make this, your app must be deployed on the server.

online examination site/App-

Add questions with multiple choices

Book rental system-

stock management system-

Pocket Calculator

a chatting app like a messenger

Make some sort of stripped-down Slack app.

 what features you must need to implement:

People enter without authentication and are assigned a name, stored for when they come back.

Store the history.

Add notifications.

With this app, you will understand:

Web sockets (instant messaging)

How native apps work.

How layouts work in native.

Routing for native apps.

Team management app-

21 Easy JavaScript Projects for Beginners (Code included!) Skillcrusht
https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/


Here I will talk about some projects that will help you to improve your programming skills. Projects You Can Do To Build Your programming Skills. These projects will boost your knowledge of programming language and framework if you used with language. Following are the projects you can try:

FTP Client-

suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app.

Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.

HTTP Server-

To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server.

Build a simple operating system-

This is a project that is technically daring and will deepen your understanding of how computers and operating systems work. You might want to start with the free (and cleverly named) book, Operating Systems: From 0 to 1. Any programming language you can use that you want to master.

Build a web scraper-

Build a tool that takes a URL as an input and returns the content of the URL as HTML or XML.

Bandwidth monitor-

Build a tool to track how much information you have downloaded or uploaded on the internet. Have it email you a weekly summary of your usage. As a bonus challenge, predict peak usage times. Use a live-updating CLI tool.

Implement a cypher-

Build a tool that takes a string of text as input and encrypts it using a cypher, such as the Caesar cypher.

Create a text message downtime alert manager-

Create an app that takes a URL as an input and sends you a text message when a request to the URL returns a response code other than 200 (OK). Use Twilio API for sending text messages

Create Personal Finance Project-

This project will help you to achieve a practical goal (get a better handle on your finances), while also improving your software engineering skills.

Create A net worth calculator and tracker-.

Build a calculator you can use to track the rise or fall of your net worth monthly.

You can use something like this net value worksheet from Charles Schwab to guide you.

Optional extension: have it give you a 12-month report for the previous year on the first of January each year. You can make CLI, web, or mobile apps.

Create A tax forecaster-

This will be especially useful if you do any freelance software engineering. Build a tool that takes your freelance incomes as input and then predicts your expected tax liability for the rest of the financial year. Make it smart enough to predict periods of higher or lower need for your services, and adjust accordingly.

Create A deal finder-

Build a simple web app to notify you when an item you covet goes on sale for a good price. You could use a web scraper to pull the list of items from the product page and notify you of any price changes. Implement web apps with mobile notifications.

Create An expense tracker-

Create a simple interface you can use to add and categorize your expenses. Generate monthly reports based on the inputs and write custom alerts for things, like, spending too much money on coffee as always.

Create A financial independence calculator-

Financial independence is, essentially, saving and investing as much of your income as possible so that you don’t need to work for money.

While many financially independent people continue to work, they can now focus on doing work that they love, rather than work that pays the most. Build a tool to calculate, based on your: current savings, investments, income, retirement accounts, and expenses, how far away you are from financial independence.

Some examples: FIREcalc, cFIREsim.

Create A bill splitter-

Build a simple tool to help you and your friends split bills when you go out to eat together.

The feature that you have to include in A bill tracker:

Log bills, amounts, and dates-List bills. Have a few graphs this year / last year.

Store them somewhere.

Log expenses and tag them (or have categories), List expenses

https://youtu.be/sU4z4Ti-8OQ

Create A random name generator-

Build a random name generator (example) that creates unique names on the fly, based on an algorithm. Use machine learning techniques to help you by training the program with a sample data set of names similar to those you want to generate. Otherwise, create your own lexical rules for how names are generated. For example, a name generating algorithm inspired by The Handmaid’s Tale might stipulate that names for Handmaid women should start with ‘Of’, and end with a random male name, e.g., Ofpeter.

Conway’s Game of Life-

Conway’s Game of Life simulates the lives of simple cells that obey algorithmic laws. Use a platform capable of real-time graphical rendering. For this, first, you have to learn how the game works.

A procedurally generated map maker-

Create a browser-based application that allows users to procedurally generate a terrain map based on a random seed. The map can be as detailed or as simple as you’d like. This project is a good opportunity to learn about procedural generation.

A character generator-

Create a tool that allows you to randomly create playable characters for your favourite role-playing games, whether they be tabletop games, like Pathfinder, or video games, like Divinity: Original Sin. Create browser-based or mobile app, CLI.

Interactive fiction-

A fun way to get into game development without having to worry about graphical assets, interactive fiction renders the world for the player through text descriptions.

The Dreamhold is a good example of interactive fiction with a useful help command.

Microlearning app-

Build an application that sends you one page per day about something you want to learn. This could be a random page from Wikipedia, a page of React documentation, a Kanji character, or a page from the CIA World Factbook.

Slack bot-

If you or your team use the public chat app Slack, build a bot to make some aspect of your (or your team’s) life easier. Use Slack API.

Ideas: a coffee order bot, a bot that reports daily on the number of commits made to your team Repos, or a daily stand-up reminder bot.

Daily desktop background-

Build an application that refreshes your desktop background with a new image every day.

Use Unsplash API, the scripting language for your OS.

Lunch picker-

If you’re a working software developer, you’ve probably wrestled with one of the toughest questions in software development. Where should I have lunch?

Your lunch picker is the tool you’ll turn to answer this question. It can be simple and pick from a series of options you know you like at random, or more complex pulling in data from Google Reviews and taking into account: location, price, and type of cuisine.

Date planner-

One of the hardest things about dating, or being in a long-term relationship is deciding where to go on dates. Build a tool that searches restaurant reviews, event calendars, and other data for date idea suggestions.

Create a tool to simplify your email newsletters-

If you’re like me, you receive way too many email newsletters every week and they clutter up your inbox. Instead of unsubscribing from each of them in a fit of rage, build a tool that captures these emails and compiles them all into a single email that is sent once a week.

Use scripts hooked up to a mail server.

Bring your umbrella notifier-

Build a simple mobile application that sends you a phone notification in the morning telling you if you should take your umbrella to work (e.g., if it is going to rain in your area that day).

Collection tracker-

Build a tool to keep a record of something you collect.

You could keep track of the value of the item, the year it was made, its condition, and its location.

Create a training or coaching institute website-

features need to implement here-

Automatic Attendance in the system will be updated if students punch their i cards.

If any student will be absent then the system will detect it and send automatic SMS to the parents of that student.

Message to the institute manager if the fee is deposited.

Inquiry data stored in the system, that can be accessed(watched) from anywhere.

Inquiry data automatically erases if a student takes admission who enquire.

Student database stored in the system and can be viewed by different criteria like batch-wise, class-wise etc.

A reminder will be sent to the owner of the fee of the student not deposited on time.

While taking the fee deposit, the system will show the current fee including the pending fee and other charges.

There will be an option for login from where the owner can log in to check all these data.

Another login account for a receptionist who will feed enquiry data, fee update, upload notes for students, embed youtube videos of class etc.

Design Preferences: Front end will show only data like Info about the coaching centre, photos, notes of students class/course wise, videos of classes/courses etc.

create collection management projects like-

applications for books, music, podcasts, games, etc using the libre templates.

Create a To-do list app-

A to-do list that syncs with Google Spreadsheets and Evernote (using their APIs)

Create Idea tracker-

Create a mobile app to let you very quickly jot down a startup idea and share the list or partial list with a friend. Syncing with Google Spreadsheets is key.

registry app-

A merged registry that creates a merged view of multiple registries. Many people are doing unified [baby/wedding] registries, but they have a major weakness in that they don’t show if someone has purchased an item. This would allow someone to create many registries with just one view/link to give out to people.

Create a chat widget-

A chat widget that allows “branching” of conversations. You know how you’ll be in the middle of a conversation with someone and then another topic would come up? What if you could branch that part out to a new conversation? you can check the Chrome extension To overlay Yelp reviews on OpenTable.

Forum on the Fly-

Be able to create a very quick forum on the fly by just sending a link, supporting conversation threading and other things.

Online polls-

Online polls that don’t suck/get covered with ads. Think Doodle for polls.

Social book recommender-

Use Amazon receipts in the email (this can be done — TripIt can scan Gmail) or screen scrape Amazon past purchases to know what you’ve previously purchased. Then let you see what books have been most purchased by your friends. So many people I know want this.

Other projects-

Any app on your phone/computer that you think could be done slightly better (or better for your purpose).

Suggestion If you want to learn then commit it socially like sign up on Twitter and post your progress daily. It is also a good way to learn code.

Example-

I’m publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today! Learn More and Join me! hey @tagyourmentor #100DaysOfCode
